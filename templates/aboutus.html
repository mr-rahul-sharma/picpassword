        <a href="/">PicPassword</a> is a user account management system that uses graphical password authentication.
        <br><br>
        Background: Passwords are ubiquitous today on any platform, on possibly any website.
        But to remember so difficult passwords and that too on numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project illustrating graphical password strategy.
        This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern to login o the system.
        <br><br>
        Objective: In this method, the user is required to select some images (let's say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example dairy milk is followed by 5 stars which is in turn followed by KitKat and so on).
        Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially.
        Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways.
        This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it.
        We need techniques that can be easily implemented and provide better results to this process.
        <br><br>
        Summary: Remembering numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a user.
        So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password.
